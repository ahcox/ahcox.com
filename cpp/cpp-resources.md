### C++ Debugging Resources
* [**rr:** A deterministic **r**ecord and **r**eplay tool for C++](http://rr-project.org/).
  Allows a run of an application to be fully captured.
  This trace can then be replayed under gbd to allow debugging,
  both forwards and efficiently backwards. 

### Libraries
* [**musl:**](https://www.musl-libc.org) A Linux libc implementation which is designed to be
  statically linkable as well as small, efficient, and readable.

### Standards Documents
* [**Parallelism TS:**](https://github.com/cplusplus/parallelism-ts) Improvements to C++ concurrency support aimed
  at exploiting multiple cores and heterogenous compute capabilities.
