* [C.4: Make a function a member only if it needs direct access to the representation of a class](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rc-member)
  I first saw this one in a Scott Meyers book.
  It makes sense: fight class bloat, keep each class as small and thus as understandable as possible.
